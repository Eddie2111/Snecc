# The Snake Game from Nokia1100 is back alive using JavaScript

I made this under 30 minutes. (Because I was bored and it was sociology exam)

## How to access this game?

Go to this website

### https://eddie2111.github.io/snecc/

This website requires javascript to be enabled in order to run

Just plays with 2D array spacing.

I have future plans for this game, I will (might) add a UI for this

Until then

### Stay tuned and Enjoy!
